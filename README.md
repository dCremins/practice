# Programming Practice

This Repository is for practice coding exercises. Mostly I am using it right now to learn Go

## Exercises

[Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-medium/107/linked-list/783/)
: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

[Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)
: Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

[Bad First Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)
: You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
: Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
: You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

[Search Insert](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)
: Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

[Squares of a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/)
: Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

[Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)
: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

[Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)
: Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
: Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

[Two Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)
: Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
: Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2, where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length.

## [Hygen](http://www.hygen.io)

A template generator. Template files are stored under `_templates`

Create Go project: `hygen golang new [project name]`

## Go Cheatsheet

Start your module using the go mod init command:
